            <h1>Getting Started Guide: Chartbeat Advertising</h1>
            <p>This guide includes complete instructions on how to install Chartbeat on your website. This includes both our editorial and advertising tools. Existing Chartbeat Publishing customers wishing to implement our advertising tools should email us for more specific instructions.</p>

            <h2>Chartbeat JavaScript</h2>
            <p>Insert this right after the opening <code>&#60;head&#62;</code> tag.
                <pre><code class="javascript">&#60;script type='text/javascript'&#62;var _sf_startpt=(new Date()).getTime()&#60;/script&#62;</code></pre>
                <p>Insert this right after the closing <code>&#60;/body&#62;</code> tag.
                    <pre><code class="javascript">&#60;script type='text/javascript'&#62;
  var _sf_async_config={};
  /** CONFIGURATION START **/
  _sf_async_config.uid = YOUR_UID; //CHANGE THIS
  _sf_async_config.domain = 'YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME'; //CHANGE THIS
  _sf_async_config.useCanonical = true;
  _sf_async_config.sections = 'Section1,Section2'; //CHANGE THIS
  _sf_async_config.authors = 'Author1,Author2'; //CHANGE THIS
  _sf_async_config.zone = 'Zone_Name'; //CHANGE THIS
  /** CONFIGURATION END **/
  
  (function(){
    function loadChartbeat() {
      window._sf_endpt=(new Date()).getTime();
        var e = document.createElement('script');
        e.setAttribute('language', 'javascript');
        e.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
        e.setAttribute('src', '//static.chartbeat.com/js/chartbeat_pub.js');
        document.body.appendChild(e);
      }
      var oldonload = window.onload;
      window.onload = (typeof window.onload != 'function') ?
        loadChartbeat : function() { oldonload(); loadChartbeat(); };
  })();
&#60;/script&#62;</code></pre>

                    <h2>Chartbeat JavaScript Instructions</h2>
                    <p><strong>We are unable to measure ad exposure on a page that lacks this JavaScript. Please ensure that this code is included globally on your site.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Place the first line of JavaScript at the beginning of your opening <code>&#60;head&#62;</code> tag.</p>

                    <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Place the second part of the JavaScript before the closing <code>&#60;/body&#62;</code> tag and ensure configuration variables are dynamically populating for each page:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Replace YOUR_UID and YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME with the uid gaven to you via email and your actual domain name (&#145;demo.com&#146; not &#145;www.demo.com&#146;). These are static variables and should be the same for all pages and subdomains on yoru site.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Configure section and author tags by dynamically populating these variables with your existing page metadata. A page may have multiple sections and authors (comma separated). For more info, you can check out our Section and Author tagging section on our <a href="#">Chartbeat Publishing Implementation Guide</a>.</p>
                            <p><i>Note these configuration variables are used to organize content by author and site section in our Editorial product. They are not usedd in the display advertising tool</i></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Define advertising zones using the <code>zone</code> configuration variable.</p>
                            <p>Chartbeat uses zones as a way of understanding how a given ad slot/position performs on different parts of your site. The zone values that you use should match how you package and sell ad units across different sections of your site.</p>
                            <p>You will need to dynamically populate the &#147;Zone Name&#148; value. Zone names should be a single string value. We can only accept one zone value per page. If you use a hierarchical site/zone structure (popular in DFP) please provide the entire hierarchy of the page with each level separated by a single slash, for example:</p>
                            <pre><code>_sf_async_config.zone = 'us/business/technology';</code></pre>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Optional: Setting up Custom Metrics</h2>
                    <p>The following snippet of code can be added to our JavaScript directly after the configuration settings (<code>/** CONFIGURATION END **/</code>) in order to send us additional user-level data.</p>

                        <pre><code>/** CUSTOM METRICS START **/
var _cbq = window._cbq || [];
_cbq.push(['_acct','USER_TYPE']);
_cbq.push(['_demo','a=30,b=finance,c=ny']);
/** CUSTOM METRICS END **/</code></pre>
                       
                        <p>The example above includes:</p>
                       
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>User Type</strong> (for sites with registered users)</p>
                                <p>If you allow users to login to your site, or provide subscriber-only content, you can pass this information to Chartbeat in order to see how much time different types of users spend engaging with your content and ads. Use the following line to define User Type:</p>
                                <pre><code>_cbq.push(['_acct', 'USER_TYPE']);</code></pre>
                                <p>For the <code>USER_TYPE</code> value, please use one of the three standardized values below:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Regular/anonymous user: 'anon'</li>
                                    <li>Logged-in/registered user: 'lgdin'</li>
                                    <li>Paid subscriber: 'paid'</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>
                                <p>If available, demographic information can be supplied via the <code>_demo</code> field, and can be provided as a comma-separated list of key/vaue pairs that you would like to identify the user with. For instance, on a page session for a user under 30 years old who lives in New York and works in finance, you could use:</p>
                                <pre><code>_cbq.push([['_demo', 'a=30,b=finance,c=ny']);</code></pre>
                                <p>Up to 8 traits may be specified per user. We ask that you try to keep key names relatively short (3 characters or less) and values at 32 characters or less. If this limitation is problematic, please <a href="http://chart.bt/help">let us know</a>. Ideally, the k/v pairs that you send will match our existing internal k/v structure. If you are sending demographic data, please also be sure to <a href="http://chart.bt/help">email us</a> a table that includes the descriptive names for keys and values.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Special Considerations: Dynamic Page Loading / AJAX</h2>                      
                        <p>If your site changes pages without reloading the DOM, you might signal to Chartbeat that this change is occuring via the <code>pSUPERFLY.virtualPage()</code> function. This should be called as part of the page change event and BEFORE new ads are loaded onto the page. New configuration variables should be set for the target page prior to calling <code>virtualPage()</code>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        
                        <pre><code>_sf_async_config.sections = 'New Section 1, New Section 2';
_sf_async_config.authors = 'New Author';
_sf_async_config.zone = 'New Zone';
pSUPERFLY.virtualPage('/new_page_path','New Page Title');</code></pre>
                        
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please ensure that the path parameter that you use is a relative path (as showin in the example).</p>
                        
                        <p>Please do not call the <code>virtualPage()</code> function on the initial (real) page load as this will cause inaccurate referall data. It should only be called for page changes that happen after the initial page load.</p>

                        <h1>Campaign Tracking with DFP Integration</h1>                        
                        <p>Chartbeat integrates with your DFP account in order to communicate campaign tracking and display helpful information abot your campaigns in the Chartbeat user interface. Below you&#146;ll find instructions on how to set up this integration for both DFP Premium and Small Business.</p>

                        <h2>Setup Oauth</h2>
                        <p>In order for Chartbeat to have access to your DFP data, you must Oauth into your DFP account from the Chartbeat Ads dashboard. Simply click into the Settings panel, navigate to the Oauth Settings tab, select your domain, input your DFP network code and click &#145;Authorize DFP Access&#146;. This will open a Google authorization screen in a new window. Grant access to Chartbeat and you&#146;re good to go!</p>

                        <h2>Adding the Tracking Code</h2>
                        <p>Chartbeat&#146;s campaign tracker will measure exposure time for each impression in a campaign. This allows us to analyze performance for each piece of creative in a campaign, as well as the campaign as a whole. In order to do this, the following code must be included in all creatives that are served during a campaign.</p>
                        
                        <pre><code>&#60;div id="chartbeat-ad-data" data-cb-creative-id="%ecid!" data-cb-campaign-id="%ebuy!" data-cb-placement-id="%epid!" data-cb-site-id="%esid!" data-cb-line-id="%eaid!" data-cb-creative-height="%%HEIGHT%%" data-cb-creative-width="%%WIDTH%%"&#62;&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;script src="//static.chartbeat.com/js/campaign_tracker.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;</code></pre>
                        
                        <p><i>This code makes use of DFP-specific macros. Please don&#146;t use it with other ad servers.</i></p>
                        
                        <p>This code can be added manually to the end of the snippet of each cretive in a campaign. However, we recommend that you automate this process by either creativing a Creative Wrapper or creating a custom Creative Template.</p>

                        <h3>Creative Wrapper (DFP Premium Only)</h3>
                        <p>Creative wrappers allow you to include custom code across all creatives served in a given ad unit or network. they are the easiest way to ensure that all campaigns running on your site include the Chartbeat tracking script.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Create a new Creative Wrapper</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to the Admin section of DFP and select &#145;Creative Wrappers&#146; under Labels. Then hit the &#145;New Creative Wrapper&#146; button.</li>
                            <li>Give the wrapper a lable, for example, &#147;Chartbeat Tracking Code&#148;.</li>
                            <li>Copy and paste the code snippet above into the Footer box.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the wrapping order is set to Outer.</li>
                        
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><i>In cases where you are using another Creative Wrapper that must be set to Outer, you may alternatively use No Preference for the Chartbeat wrapper.</i></p>
                    
                    </p><i>If you are unfamiliar with Creative Wrappers in DFP, you can find more detailed information at <a href="https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/2797762?hl=en" target="_blank">Google's Support Page</a>.</i></p>
                
                <div>[Image Here]</div>
                
                <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Apply the Creative Wrapper to all Ad Units on your site</p>
                <p>The easiest way to do this is going to the Inventory tab, selecting your sitewide ad unit, and adding the Chartbeat creative wrapper in the Label field.</p>

                <h3>Creating a New Creative Template (DFP Premium & Small Business)</h3>
                <p>Using this method, you will create a new Creative template in DFP that includes the Chartbeat tracking code. When adding creative to a campaign, you must select htis new creative template in order to ensure that it tracks correctly in Chartbeat.</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Copy an existing creative template that you use frequently.</p>
                <p>In the &#145;Orders&#146; tab, click on &#147;Creative Templates&#148; under the Creative heading. Select an existing template and click the Copy button.</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Modify the copy with Chartbeat code.</p>
                <p>Find the copy that you just made and click into it. You&#146;ll want to give it a new name, for example: &#147;Image Banner with Chartbeat&#148;. Then, copy and paste the Chartbeat tracking code into the snippet box. Make sure that the Chartbeat code is added to the end of any existing code in the snippet.</p>
                <p><i>You will need to repeat Steps 1 &amp; 2 for each Creative template you use in DFP</i></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> When setting up a new campaign, make sure you use the version of the Creative template that includes the Chartbeat tracking code.</p>

                <h2>Verify Your Implementation</h2>
                <p>Once you&#146;ve got everything set up for a campaignn, use our debug overlay to verify your implementation. To activate the debug overlay, append the following query paramter to the test URL that you wish to check:</p>
                <code>?__cb_debug=2</code>
                <p><i>Note that if the test URL already has multiple query paramters, you should use <code>&amp;__cb_debug=2</i></code>
                    <p>The debug overlay will place a blue border around all ads on the page that Chartbeat is tracking. If the creative tracking code is implemented correctly, the Campaign ID and Creative ID will be displayed for each ad.</p>


                    <h1>Campaign Tracking with All Ad Servers</h1>
                    <p>Chartbeat Advertising is built on top of the existing Chartbeat Publishing code on your site. If you do <strong>not</strong> already have Chartbeat Publishing code on your site, please refer to our <a href="#">Getting Started Guide.</a>

                        <h2>Ads Served in iFrames</h2>
                        <p>In order to track ads served in iFrames you&#146;ll need to add the following tag to the HTML inside the iFrame. Make sure you are generating your own creative and campaign IDs. These attributes should contain values that you want us to track/display on the dashboard (so make them nice and friendly!).</p>
                        <pre><code>&#60;div id="chartbeat-ad-data" data-cb-creative-id="put_the_creative_id_here" data-cb-campaign-id="put_the_campaign_id_here"&#62;&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;script src="//static.chartbeat.com/js/campaign_tracker.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;</code></pre>
                        <p>Also, please ensure that each iFrame has a unique name. This is important because it allows us to associate the campaign-specific data we&#146;re pulling with the data from the rest of the advertising product. <strong>If there is no id attribute on the iFrame itself, the campaign tracking system will not work.</strong></p>

                        <h2>Ads NOT Served in iFrames</h2>
                        <p>For non-iFrame embedded advertisements, we require the <code>data-cb-campaign-id</code> and <code>data-cb-creative-id</code> attributes to be placed either on the ad container <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> that we are already tracking (via <code>data-cb-ad-id</code>) OR on any element within the ad container <code>&#60;div&#62;</code>.</p>


                        <h1>Paid Content</h1>
                        <p>Included in the Chartbeat Publishing suite is a tool that allows you to measure page-level engagement on paid content pieces for optimization and reporting purposes. For any page you wish to track with our paid content product, please add the <code>sponsorName</code> property to the <code>_sf_async_config</code> object on that page:</p>
                        <pre><code>_sf_async_config.sponsorName = "INSERT_SPONSOR_NAME_HERE";</code></pre>
                        <p>Like sections, authors, and zone, you will need to dynamically populate the <code>sponsorName</code> value for each page. <strong>Do not</strong> include the <code>sponsorName</code> property on pages that are not paid content.</p>
                        <p>Data for paid content is organized by unique URL path. Since promotional efforts for paid content tend to apend UTM tags and other additioal URL query paramters, please ensure that you are defining a canonical link on all paid content pages. For more info, see <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066" target="_blank">Google's guide to Canonical Links</a>.</p>
